It should be easier than ever to get started with Tivoli. Signing in is now automatically done using the browser. The launcher can now auto-update so quickly you might even miss it. Interface will also auto-update so quickly you might even miss it. ...all as fast as a fox! \ud83e\udd8a This new update will make it 1000 times easier for us to push out new updates! Some other changes include: Added versions section in settings Added search to the world selector Updated to Electron 14 (coming from 8, gosh) Interface 0.18.0 - September 17, 2021 \u00b6 General updates: Tivoli will now close a little bit faster Added option Settings > Disable Web Entities (requires reconnect after toggle) When seated, avatars won't rotate with the camera anymore Updated the API Reference so legacy documentation links work again Updated OpenSSL to 1.1.1l on Windows Bug fixes: Fixed world server spawn orientation (Tivoli uses xyzW, not Wxyz) Fixed avatars not standing up whilst sitting when changing worlds Create tools grid is now more visible and doesn't get obscured Updates to scripting : Added MyAvatar.getBoomLength() for the third person camera Added MyAvatar.setBoomLength(boomLength) to complement the above 0.17.3 - February 28, 2021 \u00b6 Added glTF draco decompression support Added world selector to launcher with a setting to always spawn at tutorial Updated the launcher's crash dialog which will help you reset your settings Disabled assimp logging, which caused a lot of crashing 0.17.2 - January 20, 2021 \u00b6 Fixed frequent crashes related to assimp from the last update Added support for embedding YouTube videos in chat When launching Tivoli for the first time , it'll try to guess your graphics settings Improved \"Avatar from my Tivoli files\" in avatar app Updates to models : Fully implemented vertex colors on glTF models Fixed unlit colors using incorrect color space on glTF models Fixed crash when loading empty animations from animGraphURL in .fst files Updates to scripting : Added MyAvatar.getAvatarPreviewImageURL() which will return the url relative to the preview property in .fst files . Avatar previews will also show in the avatar app. Added locallyVisible as an entity property which lets your hide or show entities locally 0.17.1 - January 9, 2021 \u00b6 A very small patch that fixes the Ready Player Me avatar creator available in the things app. 0.17.0 - January 9, 2021 \u00b6 Happy new year from everyone at Tivoli! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf88 This update is an exciting start to the year with some courageous new features. The biggest feature today is the addition of assimp , a multi-format 3D model importing library! glTF models now use assimp and support armatures! This means we can use the Ready Player Me avatar creator which will be available for testing in the things app . Please try it out! It may not work well in VR yet. A couple things may still be broken such as animations, joints and vertex colors Draco decompression will be support soon which is already available in Blender Assimp will automatically optimize 3D models when importing, in ways such as: Joining identical vertices to reduce draw calls and GPU memory Find identical meshes and instance them which will reduce GPU memory and work Splitting large meshes every 1 million vertices/faces to optimize large meshes Improve cache locality which will optimize rendering on modern hardware Lots of other 3D file formats are supported too now, such as: .3ds, .blend (2.79, soon 2.9), .dae, .ply, .stl, and many more available here Another feature is the addition of libsndfile , a multi-format audio parsing library! Lots of audio file formats are supported now such as: .mp3, .ogg, .flac, .aiff and more available here All .wav files are supported now so no need to export with exact settings .mp3 files don't have the annoying crackling sound anymore! It's now possible to use flac for losslessly compressed ambisonic sound Then we have two lovely updates from FluffyJenkins and Humbletim : New properties on the main Camera such as parentID , parentJointIndex , localPosition , locationRotation Enhancements to avatar parenting adds new properties to MyAvatar such as localPosition , localRotation , localVelocity and more All of these changes are little contributions to getting vehicles to work! Thank you~ \u2764\ufe0f General changes to interface : Added show self for nametags in the graphics settings Added brotli decompression to http and tea requests If you upload a .br or .gz file to Tivoli files, accessing it through the url without the compressed extension will serve the compressed version if available.

Thank you for waiting so patiently. There are some exciting changes in this version! Starting with the... Initial release of the things app where you can find all kinds of avatars , scripts and entities! Currently maintained on the things repo on our GitLab , it'll replace the market app for now. When tea:// content protection and inventory are implemented, we can start working on a real marketplace in the future.

The biggest feature today is the addition of assimp , a multi-format 3D model importing library! glTF models now use assimp and support armatures! This means we can use the Ready Player Me avatar creator which will be available for testing in the things app . Please try it out! It may not work well in VR yet. A couple things may still be broken such as animations, joints and vertex colors Draco decompression will be support soon which is already available in Blender Assimp will automatically optimize 3D models when importing, in ways such as: Joining identical vertices to reduce draw calls and GPU memory Find identical meshes and instance them which will reduce GPU memory and work Splitting large meshes every 1 million vertices/faces to optimize large meshes Improve cache locality which will optimize rendering on modern hardware Lots of other 3D file formats are supported too now, such as: .3ds, .blend (2.79, soon 2.9), .dae, .ply, .stl, and many more available here Another feature is the addition of libsndfile , a multi-format audio parsing library! Lots of audio file formats are supported now such as: .mp3, .ogg, .flac, .aiff and more available here All .wav files are supported now so no need to export with exact settings .mp3 files don't have the annoying crackling sound anymore! It's now possible to use flac for losslessly compressed ambisonic sound Then we have two lovely updates from FluffyJenkins and Humbletim : New properties on the main Camera such as parentID , parentJointIndex , localPosition , locationRotation Enhancements to avatar parenting adds new properties to MyAvatar such as localPosition , localRotation , localVelocity and more All of these changes are little contributions to getting vehicles to work!

There is also a (highly experimental) lightmapping system which can bake and generate lightmaps that are automatically applied to the models in your scene. The tools support Blender 2.8, and have been tested up to 2.8.3. Install the Tivoli Blender Tools add-on \u00b6 Download the Tivoli Blender Tools add-on .zip file from our GitLab. Select the relevant version depending on your operating system. You do not need to download the source files. Launch (or install) the current LTS version of Blender . In Blender, select Edit > Preferences and click the Add-ons tab on the left. Press the Install button and select the add-on .zip file you downloaded in Step 1 . Check the checkbox next to the add-on to activate it Using the Tivoli Blender Tools add-on JSON exporter \u00b6 In Blender, open or create a scene with multiple polygon models. Press the n key to open Blender's sidebar panel. Click the Tivoli tab on the sidebar panel. Paste or type the path to the folder where the scene will be hosted. If using Tivoli Files , you can create an empty folder and copy its URL. Save the scene and press Export scene to JSON button. A new folder is generated next to the .blend file with the exported models, textures and JSON file. Upload the contents of the new folder to Tivoli Files or your server. Be sure that the path of your server folder matches the one you used in Step 4 . Learn how you can upload and host your assets for free on Tivoli Files. Info If you check the WebP Optimize Textures checkbox, the tool will automatically convert all textures into .webp files, a highly optimized and efficient, lossless image format, which generally yields better image quality and smaller file size than JPEG. Converting textures to WebP can take time, so be aware that this will slow down your export. WebP in Tivoli is relatively new, so if you experience unexpected results with your textures, you may want to avoid using this feature. Importing the scene in Tivoli Cloud VR \u00b6 In Tivoli, go to a world where you have create rights. Select Edit>Import Entities from URL . Paste the URL to the JSON file you uploaded in Step 7 above. Tip Collection instances are respected in the add-on! For example, if you have a cafe scene with ten collection instances of a coffee cup placed in your scene, the Blender add-on will automatically recognize the instances and export just a single model file, which is then placed as multiple entities in the JSON file, rather than exporting and linking to ten different coffee-cup models. This means fewer files to download, a smaller memory footprint, and makes changing and updating all instances very easy. Experimental Lightmap Baking \u00b6 The Blender Tools add-on includes a highly experimental lightmap baker feature. This should be used with caution and only with backed-up files. Warning The Tivoli Blender Tools add-on includes a highly experimental lightmap baking feature. This feature alters your scene and textures and may inadvertently break your scene . If you wish to test out this feature, WORK FROM A COPY of your .blend file, not an original. Do not attempt to use the lightmapper with any .blend file you cannot afford to break. Save a copy of your .blend file and open it, because lightmapping will alter your original file, then check the I understand and agree warning checkbox. Click Prepare UV Maps . The add-on will iterate through your models and create a second UV map for each model called Tivoli_Lightmap. Click Prepare Materials . This will create and apply a lightmap material file for each mesh. If you choose Auto Texture Size , the scale of the texture file used will be calculated relative to the surface area of the models, otherwise you can specify a fixed resolution size. Using auto texture size will result in faster load times and smaller memory footprint. If you need to undo this, you can hit Restore Materials to return to the original materials. Optionally de-noise the lightmaps by clicking Denoise with Intel OIDN , which will use Intel's OIDN algorithm to clean up and improve the quality of the lightmaps.

Using auto texture size will result in faster load times and smaller memory footprint. If you need to undo this, you can hit Restore Materials to return to the original materials. Optionally de-noise the lightmaps by clicking Denoise with Intel OIDN , which will use Intel's OIDN algorithm to clean up and improve the quality of the lightmaps. Make sure Export Scene as JSON is checked, and press the Export Scene as JSON button. Check the option WebP Optimize Textures button if desired (see info below).","title":"Experimental Lightmap Baking"},{"location":"models/custom-materials/","text":"Custom materials \u00b6 With Tivoli, you can manually specify the properties of your materials.

You will need: a little bit of knowledge of how Docker works a machine with any distribution of Linux 64 bit, x86_64 or arm64v8 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose \u00b6 If you're using Ubuntu (from the official docs Docker and Docker Compose ): sudo apt-get update -y sudo apt-get install -y curl python3-pip libffi-dev # docker curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh sudo sh get-docker.sh # docker compose sudo pip3 install docker-compose # start system service sudo systemctl enable docker sudo systemctl start docker # add user to group sudo usermod -aG docker $USER Or if you're using Arch Linux : sudo pacman -Sy docker docker-compose sudo systemctl enable docker sudo systemctl start docker sudo usermod -aG docker $USER You will have to log out so that your current user is part of the docker group. Run docker system info to verify if it's running and installed. If you're using another distro, look here: Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install You will find plenty of guides on Google too. 2. Structuring your configuration \u00b6 You will need to create a folder where all your world(s) will live. This is entirely portable so it's easy to backup or migrate. mkdir worlds cd worlds Write a new file inside the folder using your favorite text editor: docker-compose.yml version : \"3.6\" services : # remove this service to disable auto updating watchtower : image : containrrr/watchtower:latest restart : always labels : - com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.scope=tivoli-server environment : # check for updates at 4 am every day - WATCHTOWER_SCHEDULE=0 0 4 * * * - WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP=true volumes : - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro my-world : image : registry.tivolicloud.com/tivolicloud/interface/server:latest network_mode : host restart : always logging : driver : none labels : - com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.scope=tivoli-server volumes : - ./my-world:/root/.local/share/Tivoli Cloud VR environment : - HIFI_DOMAIN_SERVER_HTTP_PORT=40100 - HIFI_DOMAIN_SERVER_HTTPS_PORT=40101 - HIFI_DOMAIN_SERVER_PORT=40102 - HIFI_DOMAIN_SERVER_DTLS_PORT=40103 - HIFI_ASSIGNMENT_CLIENT_AUDIO_MIXER_PORT=48000 - HIFI_ASSIGNMENT_CLIENT_AVATAR_MIXER_PORT=48001 - HIFI_ASSIGNMENT_CLIENT_ASSET_SERVER_PORT=48003 - HIFI_ASSIGNMENT_CLIENT_MESSAGES_MIXER_PORT=48004 - HIFI_ASSIGNMENT_CLIENT_ENTITY_SCRIPT_SERVER_PORT=48005 - HIFI_ASSIGNMENT_CLIENT_ENTITIES_SERVER_PORT=48006 Rename every instance of my-world with the name of your world. volumes : - ./my-world:/root/.local/share/Tivoli Cloud VR This part of the config explains that Docker should mount the folder my-world inside of your working folder to the server configuration files . Please make sure there's only one volume mounted per server . This folder must be kept safe. Auto updating \u00b6 At the top of the docker-compose.yml file, you'll see a service named watchtower . It's responsible for auto updating your worlds. For each world service running, you'll find a label named com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.scope=tivoli-server , which indicates that it should be registered with watchtower in order to get checked for updates. If you'd like to completely remove auto updating, remove the watchtower service and labels attached to each world: labels: - com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.scope=tivoli-server Feel free to duplicate the service for as many worlds as you want . However, remember that the server software can be heavy to run if there are many people connected. If you add more than one server, you must update the port numbers defined in the environment array. Usually we go up in increments of 10 but you can set them to whatever you like. 3. Starting, restarting, stopping and updating \u00b6 Docker Compose is really awesome for running Docker containers. This is all super easy. Make sure you're inside the folder where docker-compose.yml is and you can run: docker-compose up -d starts all servers and syncs your docker-compose.yml config . docker-compose down stops all servers , gracefully. docker-compose pull checks if there's a new version and downloads it . Run up -d after and all your servers will update to the new version. docker-compose restart/stop/start my-world will restart, stop or start a server . docker-compose logs -f shows the logs for all servers. There are some Docker commands you might want to know as well: docker images shows all downloaded images on your machine. These can be big! docker rmi removes an image such as an old version of Tivoli server. docker ps shows all running docker containers . Check the servers' logs and if there are no errors, it's running! If you want to update your servers, run these commands: docker-compose pull docker-compose up -d 4. Connecting your server to a Tivoli world \u00b6 This part is a little messy and that will change . We're still in alpha and have major redesigning to do from the old server admin panel. Open your web browser and visit: http://localhost:40100 Step 1 of 2 : Click \"Connect your Tivoli Cloud World\" and you will be redirected to your worlds. Click \"Create new world\" and fill as much as you can. Once your world has been created, click \"Generate new access token\" and copy the token. This is a secret key that binds your server to your world . You can revoke it at any time by generating a new token. Go back to your server web page and paste the token . Click \"OK\" . Step 2 of 2 : Add the usernames of the people who you want to give full permissions to. Who can join and create: None : Nobody will have access. Will make your world private. Friends : Your friends from the account you connected the server with. Everyone logged in : Securely available to everyone. Linking the server correctly with the world : You will now find yourself in the admin panel. In the settings page at the very top: Expand \"Advanced Settings\" and click \"Choose from my worlds\" . Only one world will be available. Click \"Save and restart\" : After the page has reloaded, you will now find: Automatic Networking must be set to either: Full : This doesn't require port forwarding . It will automatically establish a connection using the ICE protocol. Warning Whilst this is really convenient, keep in mind that this can cause connection problems . It's much more reliable to port forward and use the below instead. IP Only : Just specify the port and it will work as a free DNS. None : Where you specify a static external IP address and port. Network Address:Port or Network Port must be set accordingly. The port is set to HIFI_DOMAIN_SERVER_PORT which is usually 40102 (+2 from the admin panel HTTP port) Info If Automatic Networking is not set to full , you'll have to make sure that these ports are open on your firewall or router for TCP and UDP : 40100-40110 48000-48010 Now that those settings have been set, everything should work! 5. Installation complete! \u00b6 You can now find your world in https://tivolicloud.com/user/worlds which should indicate that there are 0 users . If it says Offline , then something went wrong. You can always message us or the community for help on our Discord server . https://tivolicloud.com/discord I hope this guide was useful to you and you can enjoy your own space in the metaverse!

We're still in alpha and have major redesigning to do from the old server admin panel. Open your web browser and visit: http://localhost:40100 Step 1 of 2 : Click \"Connect your Tivoli Cloud World\" and you will be redirected to your worlds. Click \"Create new world\" and fill as much as you can. Once your world has been created, click \"Generate new access token\" and copy the token. This is a secret key that binds your server to your world . You can revoke it at any time by generating a new token. Go back to your server web page and paste the token . Click \"OK\" . Step 2 of 2 : Add the usernames of the people who you want to give full permissions to. Who can join and create: None : Nobody will have access. Will make your world private. Friends : Your friends from the account you connected the server with. Everyone logged in : Securely available to everyone. Linking the server correctly with the world : You will now find yourself in the admin panel. In the settings page at the very top: Expand \"Advanced Settings\" and click \"Choose from my worlds\" . Only one world will be available. Click \"Save and restart\" : After the page has reloaded, you will now find: Automatic Networking must be set to either: Full : This doesn't require port forwarding . It will automatically establish a connection using the ICE protocol. Warning Whilst this is really convenient, keep in mind that this can cause connection problems . It's much more reliable to port forward and use the below instead. IP Only : Just specify the port and it will work as a free DNS. None : Where you specify a static external IP address and port. Network Address:Port or Network Port must be set accordingly. The port is set to HIFI_DOMAIN_SERVER_PORT which is usually 40102 (+2 from the admin panel HTTP port) Info If Automatic Networking is not set to full , you'll have to make sure that these ports are open on your firewall or router for TCP and UDP : 40100-40110 48000-48010 Now that those settings have been set, everything should work!","title":"4.
